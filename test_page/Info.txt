Place htm web page for tests in this directory 
and open it from browser via https://localhost:8000/test/test_page/Test.htm

For example, if you test userscript on firefox, this is necessary to:
- workaround Firefox ban on Tapermonkey local file access
- utilize https userscript requests instead of http which may be unreliable during debug
- possibly https requests will update every first page refresh while https need constantly 2-3 page reloads
