# Python https server   
Just a shortcut for common tests, openssl binary already included (only for windows x64 & python ready).  
1) Fix python path if nessesary in run_server.bat  
2) generate_certificate.bat
3) run_server.bat

Server will start with folder already above current.
To test, open in browser https://localhost:8000/
